                                the existing produce, we explored new avenues and came up with something unconventional
                                yet so basic which would not only satisfy our current needs but also provide additional
                                health benefits. We bring into the limelight an algae - Spirulina which might as well be
                                the food of the future and has the potential to be in everything you eat in the next ten
                                years.
                                Easy to grow and densely packed with protein, these organisms can make our food system
                                more efficient and less resource-intensive.
